# 4-GoExplore

## DataScience Project 4 : WBS Coding School
This project is a part of my studies at DataScience Course which covers topics such as, Data Analysis, Google Spreadsheets, MySQL, big query & Looker Studio.
## Objective: 
GoExplore had only one spreadsheet file. The objective is to analyze KPIs and Metrics in the spreadsheet and large query and display the results as a dashboard presentation with Looker Studio.

## üíº Case study: GoExplore

Details of this project are as follows:

GoExplore is a small but rapidly growing company and a successful supplier of camping and hiking equipment that is experiencing phenomenal growth year after year. GoExplore only had one data scientist managing all their data needs. Unfortunately, that person left unexpectedly, leaving the company in a bind. Desperate for a solution, they turned to you. Flattered by the headhunt and enticed by a generous salary increase, you eagerly accepted the challenge. You know you‚Äôll have to improvise along the way, but you‚Äôre ready to take on whatever comes your way.

Sabah, the CEO, welcomes you with a warm yet urgent briefing. The only thing your predecessor left behind is a single spreadsheet file. üò¨ Sabah was relying heavily on your predecessor to produce data insights and, without a clear view of the company‚Äôs performance, he‚Äôs counting on you to rectify this in just two weeks. When you asked for specific instructions, Sabah‚Äôs response was clear: ‚ÄúJust get it done!‚Äù

The weight of the company‚Äôs data needs now rests on your shoulders. Let‚Äôs outline our mission:

1. Start by thinking through what kinds of insights Sabah might be expecting. What are the usual things businesses want to know? What might be hiding in this particular dataset?
  + What are common insights companies want?
  + What are some insights specific to this data?
2. We‚Äôll begin by exploring the spreadsheets to find some quick wins: calculating overall figures and creating a few simple visualisations. This should help us build a clearer picture of how the company is doing and might point us towards areas worth investigating further.
3. It‚Äôs clear the company wants to make better use of its data, but right now everything is still stuck in spreadsheets, which can be limiting. To make better use of it, we‚Äôll move it into a data warehouse. This will help us keep things organised as the data grows, make analysis quicker and more consistent, and allow us to explore it in more flexible ways than spreadsheets can manage.
4. Lastly, we‚Äôll build an interactive dashboard. It will pull everything together and let Sabah explore what‚Äôs happening in the business by department, country, or date, all without writing a single line of code. That‚Äôs the kind of insight and accessibility he‚Äôs been missing.

On the final day you‚Äôll show Sabah what you‚Äôve done and walk him through his new analytics setup. The key to this presentation isn‚Äôt making sure he understands the tools used or theory behind them, it‚Äôs making sure Sabah understands the impact this will have on his business.

## Tools Used:
1. Google Spreadsheet
2. Google Cloud Big query
3. Google Looker Studio
   
## Datasource:
GoExplore had only one spreadsheet file.

## Key Learnings:
1. KPIs & Metrics
2. Google Spreadsheets Functions and Visualization
3. How Data is Stored in a Data Warehouse
4. OLAP & OLTP
5. Big query
6. Google Looker Stuido (using big query, data vizualization & dashboards)
7. What makes a good dashboard

## Approach

Our approach to solving the problem is 4-step: 

1- Deciding the KPIs & Metrics.

2- Using Google Spreadsheets functions and visualization to analyse and display the KPIs.

3- Using Big query to able to use mySQL and create queries for KPIs and to able to use the queries and tables in Looker Studio.

4- Visualizing the data using Google Looker Studio. creating interactive dashboards for presentation.
